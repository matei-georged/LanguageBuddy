# LanguageBuddy

This is a web platform developed as part of my undergraduate thesis using .NET. The application provides a friendly learning environment through a language exchange between young people. The platform enables users to find a language learning partner and practice together. The application includes several other features such as text to speech, a chat system that allows users to send voice messages, and interactive games designed to enhance language learning.

This repository contains the source code for the web platform, including documentation, and instructions on how to set it up for local development or deployment to a hosting service. Feel free to explore the codebase and suggest improvements. Contributions are always welcome!
